# Efficient facial representations for age, gender and identity recognition in organizing photo albums using multi-output ConvNet

Source code for facial analysis including gender recognition, age predication, clustering of similar faces and extraction of potential public photos

We provide three pre-trained models for simultaneous age/gender recognition:
1. age_gender_tf2_new-01-0.14-0.92: here we freeze the weights of the MobileNet base pre-trained on VGGFace2 for face identification
2. age_gender_tf2_new-01-0.14-0.92_quantized: the first model quantized by the Tensorflow graph_transform
3. age_gender_tf2_new-01-0.16-0.92: the first model, all weights of which were fine-tuned for age/gender recognition, i.e., the identity features became less informative
4. age_gender_tf2_224_deep-03-0.13-0.97: similar to the first model but with slightly higher accuracy
The model can be changed in the facial_analysis.py (line 45)

Change InputDirectory property in config.txt to point to the correct directory with photos (jpg/png) and video clips (mov/avi)

Required libraries: Tensorflow, OpenCV, SciPy, SKLearn, MatplotLib, MXNet (for Insightface)

Please download [exiftool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) in order to detect orientation of video clips

Script utkface_test.py contains comparison of our models with several known open-source implementations of age/gender recognition for [UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)

* [DEX VGG](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) models converted from Caffe to Tensorflow
* [Wide ResNet (weights.28-3.73.hdf5)](https://github.com/yu4u/age-gender-estimation)
* [Wide ResNet (weights.18-4.06.hdf5)](https://github.com/Tony607/Keras_age_gender)
* [FaceNet](https://github.com/BoyuanJiang/Age-Gender-Estimate-TF)
* [BKNetStyle2](https://github.com/truongnmt/multi-task-learning)
* [SSRNet](https://github.com/shamangary/SSR-Net)
* [MobileNet v2 (Agegendernet)](https://github.com/dandynaufaldi/Agendernet)
* Two models from [Insightface](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/)
* [Inception trained on Adience](https://github.com/dpressel/rude-carnie)

Our best model (age_gender_tf2_224_deep-03-0.13-0.97) significantly outperforms all the above-mentioned models. We achieve 91.9% gender recognition accuracy and 6.00 age prediction MAE.

In addition, we used the testing set from the SOTA paper ["Consistent Rank Logits for Ordinal Regression with Convolutional Neural Networks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07884.pdf) which uses subset of UTKFace dataset with age ranges [21,60]. Our model achieves 97.5% gender recognition accuracy and 5.39 age prediction MAE. It is lower than 5.47 MAE of the best CORAL-CNN model from this paper, which was additionally trained on another subset of UTKFace. Our model does not require such fine-tuning.
